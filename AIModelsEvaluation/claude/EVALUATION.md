## Architectural Alignment

Claude successfully followed the established domain-driven architecture, with proper folder and project structure. The domain models are stored in a distinct ```shared/domain/``` directory, separated from the backend and frontend modules.

Encapsulation between layers are clear and concise, with the Domain Models correctly handled their responsibilities (which is only to define the technical representation of the models and their attributes).
