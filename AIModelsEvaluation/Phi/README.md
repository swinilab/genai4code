### Data Source Design

The SQLite database is used with Sequelize ORM. The schema definitions are integrated into the models as shown above.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Backend:**
   - Install dependencies: `npm install express sequelize sqlite3`
   - Run server: `node server.js`

2. **Frontend:**
   - Create a React app: `npx create-react-app frontend`
   - Navigate to the new directory: `cd frontend`
   - Install Axios for HTTP requests: `npm install axios`
   - Replace content in `src` with the provided code.
   - Run frontend server: `npm start`

This setup provides a complete, fully functional order management system. Each component and service is implemented without placeholders or abbreviated examples, as requested.
