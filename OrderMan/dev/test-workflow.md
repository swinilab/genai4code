# Complete Application Workflow Test

## Overview
This document outlines the complete workflow from order creation to completion, including the accountant payment acceptance step.

## Complete Workflow Steps

### 1. Staff creates a new customer
- **Who**: Staff
- **Action**: Create customer via Customer Management
- **Status**: Customer created in system

### 2. Customer signs in and creates an order
- **Who**: Customer
- **Action**: Create order via Order Management
- **Status**: Order status = "pending"

### 3. Staff accepts order
- **Who**: Staff
- **Action**: Click "Accept Order" in Order Management
- **Status**: Order status = "accepted"

### 4. Accountant creates and sends invoice
- **Who**: Accountant
- **Action**: Create invoice via Invoice Management, then send it
- **Status**: Invoice status = "issued"

### 5. Customer sees invoice and makes payment
- **Who**: Customer or Accountant
- **Action**: Make payment via Payment Management
- **Status**: Payment status = "pending" (FIXED: was immediately "completed")

### 6. Accountant accepts payment (IMPLEMENTED)
- **Who**: Accountant
- **Action**: Click "Accept" button in Payment Management
- **Status**: 
  - Payment status = "completed"
  - Invoice status = "paid"
  - Order status = "paid"

### 7. Staff ships and completes order
- **Who**: Staff
- **Action**: Click "Ship Order" then "Close Order" in Order Management
- **Status**: Order status = "shipped" → "closed"

## Key Fixes Made

### Backend Fix (PaymentService.ts)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Payments were immediately completed
status: 'completed', // Simple: payment is immediately completed

// AFTER: Payments start as pending
status: 'pending', // Payment starts as pending and requires accountant approval
```

### Frontend Fix (PaymentBrowser.tsx)
- Fixed customer payment filtering to properly check order ownership
- Accept payment functionality was already implemented correctly

## Testing the Workflow

1. **Create Test Data**:
   - Create a customer (Staff role)
   - Create some products (Staff role)

2. **Test Order Flow**:
   - Login as customer, create an order
   - Login as staff, accept the order
   - Login as accountant, create and send invoice

3. **Test Payment Flow**:
   - Login as customer, make payment (should be "pending")
   - Login as accountant, accept payment (should update all statuses)
   - Login as staff, ship and close order

4. **Verify Status Updates**:
   - Payment: pending → completed
   - Invoice: issued → paid
   - Order: accepted → paid → shipped → closed
